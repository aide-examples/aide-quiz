## Technology Stack

For ease of teaching we wanted to have the same language on client and server, which excluded java and php. A layered architecture with a relational database is the practically most relevant environment and a "must" to teach. On the client we opted against heavy frameworks as they tend to hide some complexity which must first be understood. Furthermore such frameworks are subject to hype cycles and age rapidly. *jquery* could be an option if the UI should become more fancy.

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **SQLite** - Database (better-sqlite3)
- **Winston** - Logging with rotation

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework dependencies
- **Marked.js** - Markdown rendering
- **Modern CSS** - Responsive design

### Infrastructure
- **nginx** - Reverse proxy
- **pm2** - Service management
- **Let's Encrypt** - SSL certificates

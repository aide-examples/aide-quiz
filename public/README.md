# 📚 AIDE Quiz

This is a web application for creating and conducting online quizzes.

AIDE Quiz is part of the **[AIDE Series (Artificial Intelligence for Development Engineers)](./docs/aide/AIDE.md)**. This means:

🟦 AIDE Quiz and its documentation were developed almost entirely with *Anthropic Claude Sonnet*, not through manual coding but through dialog sessions with the AI.

🟦 We recommend making extensions as part of computer science education in the same way, while also keeping an eye on the ongoing development of the architecture documentation, which can be accessed via the *icon with the small temple*.


## 🎯 Overview

This application consists of the following components:

1. **📝 Quiz Editor** - Teachers create and manage quizzes
2. **🎓 Quiz Sessions** - Students participate in live sessions
3. **🎓 Quiz Results** - Students can view their personal results

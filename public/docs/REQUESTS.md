### This document contains several change requests which can be used as realistic training tasks to fix current flaws and introduce some new features.

* The "Start Session" button in the teacher dialog shall only be called "Session". When clicked, it opens a content page that covers the current question or its JSON representation. On this Session Page, there is a scroll box at the top showing all sessions. You can "choose to create a new session", similar to the solution we already have for selecting/creating a quiz. If the teacher selects an existing session, he will land in the STATISTICS dialog for that session (URL-ARG transfer). If he selects "new session", this refers to the previously selected quiz; The teacher must then say how long the session shall last (DURATION). Additionally, he  can specify whether it should start IMMEDIATELY (=default) or enter a begin time, for example in the format YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm; as a response, he will receive a text suitable as an invitation for participants which is automatically copied to the clipboard. The text reads "You are invited to the online quiz QUIZ_NAME. TIME_INFORMATION". The TIME_INFORMATION for a quiz that starts immediately reads: "It ends in xx minutes". Otherwise "It runs from ... to ..." or "It starts on .. at .. and lasts .." or "It starts on .. at .. and ends on .. at ..", depending on whether the quiz date matches the current day or not.
In the invitation text, QUIZ_NAME is a hyperlink to the quiz participation dialog of our app, which refers to the just-defined session via URL ARG. Additionally, the response shows a QR code below the described text, as large as possible, containing exactly this link. This is intended for the teacher to project the code via a beamer so students can scan it directly with their phones. Or alternatively in a small group: The teacher holds his tablet (phone) up to participants so they can scan the code.

* When a participant opens the quiz dialog without a URL-ARG, the list shows all open sessions. If the participant calls the quiz dialog with a session specification that is no longer valid, they receive an appropriate message. At the same time, it is checked whether submissions for the specified session exist in the DB. If yes, the participant is shown a text "The session has already ended. Enter your login code to see your result (button). Or view the results of all participants (other button)." If the specified session is not yet opened, there is a corresponding note as before. If the start time is less than 3 minutes in the future, a countdown timer appears, which automatically starts the quiz when it expires. The user then sees a note: "The quiz will start automatically when it's time"

* While working on the quiz, the user constantly sees a decent timer in the top right corner of the header next to the language selection, showing the remaining time. When the timer expires, the quiz is automatically ended. It must be ensured that the server accepts this submission even if it (due to minor time discrepancies between client and server) may be slightly late from the server's perspective. The user receives the message: The quiz has ended. Your previous answers have been submitted. Then they land as before at the dialog step where the link to the results is offered.

* When the user reaches and answers the last question, the "next question" button changes to "Done, submit". Next to it, there is another button that allows them to jump back to the first question and go through their answers sequentially again. When the user clicks this button, they are redirected to the first question and their previous answers are each marked. The submit button is displayed next to the "next question" button in this state (all questions answered).
The teacher can allow or prohibit the option to go through the answers a second time when creating a quiz. This is important because sometimes you can infer the correct answer to an earlier question from a later question.

* When a user views their personal result, they also find a link in the header area titled "View results of all participants". When the user clicks this link, they are directed to the page with the results of all participants in their session. They can thus switch to statistics, but NOT switch to other sessions there.

* Access to the statistics of a session is only granted to a student if the session has ended.
The teacher, however, can - from now on protected by their LOGIN password - see all sessions, including ongoing ones.

* The teacher can see individual results for all participants of a session in a new additional evaluation, specifically as point totals, supplemented by the list of incorrectly answered questions. This should be conveniently done as a single table.
